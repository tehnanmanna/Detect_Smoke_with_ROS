If a bag was not closed cleanly, then the index information may be corrupted. Two steps are needed to repair the bag:

$ rosbag reindex *.bag.active

$ rosbag fix *.bag.active repaired.bag 

rosbag reindex is a command-line tool for repairing broken bag files (or bag files recorded prior to ROS version 0.11.) If a bag was not closed cleanly for any reason, then the index information may be corrupted. Use this tool to reread the message data and rebuild the index.

A backup of each bag file (with the extension .orig.bag) is made before the bag is reindexed. If the backup file already exists (and the -f option isn't specified) then the tool will not reindex the file.

    reindex <bag-files>
        Reindex the given bag files.

        $ rosbag reindex *.bag

    -h, --help
        Show the usage and exit.

        $ rosbag reindex -h

    --output-dir=DIR
        Write to directory DIR.

        $ rosbag reindex --output-dir=reindexed *.bag

    -f, --force
        Force overwriting of backup file it it exists.

        $ rosbag reindex -f *.bag

    -q, --quiet
        Suppress noncritical messages.

        $ rosbag reindex -q *.bag
        


fix <in-bag> <out-bag> [rules.bmr]

    Repairs a bag using registered rules (and optionally locally defined rules).

    $ rosbag fix old.bag repaired.bag myrules.bmr

-h, --help

    Show the usage and exit.

    $ rosbag fix -h

-n, --noplugins

    Do not load rule files via plugins.

    $ rosbag fix -n old.bag repaired.bag
